This repository contains the project developed during the course "DELETED". The course focuses on teaching the fundamentals of building complex Java projects and creating a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI).

The project in this repository serves as a practical implementation of the concepts covered in the course. It demonstrates how to structure files and folders, work with text constants, create base classes, and develop the main classes for different objects with their properties and methods. The project also covers the creation of filter classes for objects, data collection and analysis, as well as proper storage of program settings, style configurations, and data formatting information.

### How to Use
To use this project, follow these steps:
2. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
3. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (IDE).
4. Build and run the project within your development environment.

Once the project is running, you can interact with the graphical user interface to perform various actions and explore its functionalities.

### Features
The project includes the following features:
- Structured file and folder organization.
- Filter class implementation for data filtering.
- Graphical user interface components (main window, menus, buttons, toolbar, date selection, file selection, etc.).
- Dialog windows for error information, operation confirmation, and data editing.
- Data output through tables with sorting and filtering capabilities.
- Statistical data visualization using third-party libraries.

### Technical Details
The project is developed in Java and utilizes various libraries to implement its functionalities. These include: Java programming language,  GUI libraries for creating the graphical user interface, third-party libraries for data visualization.
Please note that this project serves as a demonstration of the concepts taught in the course and may require additional modifications and enhancements for real-world usage scenarios.
